Thus far we have been focusing on concrete usage data collection frameworks and the specific data collected by these frameworks. When analyzing this data, or data from other collection frameworks, data analysis follows several predictable patterns, which we discuss in this section. However, we first discuss the nature of the collected data, especially whether it is anonymous, which dramatically effects how it is analyzed.
