When collecting usage data it is imporant to have the end in mind. How will this data be used to address the research question at hand? Not surprisingly, the nature of the collected data, especially whether it is anonymous, dramatically effects what can be learned.


\subsection{Types of Data}

\noindent
{\bf Non-anonymous data} (TODO: is there a better term for this?!), where sensitive information including source code snippets, change-sets, and even access to the source code base, provides obvious advantages. Researchers can replay developers' activity stream, affording them a deep understanding of the developer's actions~\cite{UseDisuseMisuseRefactoringsExtendedVersion}. There are few limits on how this data can be analyzed, and {\bf non-anonymous data is well-suited for exploratory studies}. Unfortunately, there are some key disadvantages. First, only developers working on open source systems are likely to participate; typical enterprise developers may face termination if they were to leak even parts of their source code base. Second, while playback is now possible, analyzing this data can be costly in terms of time and resources.
