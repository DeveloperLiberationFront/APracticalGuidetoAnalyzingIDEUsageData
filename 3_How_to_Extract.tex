\section{ How to Extract Attributes from Usage Data}


  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Creating meaningful classification of events
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Establish a goal for categorization
	\item
	Create categories for the goal
	\end{enumerate}
  \item Defining useful and balanced sequences % (Will, Anil)
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Define a goal for sequencing data
	\item
	Sequences aligned with time or time events.  Eg. events per day or events
	between periods of inactivity.
	\item
	Natural sequences such as events between builds, events between edits, events between check-ins.
	\item
	Creating sequences that occur along an event count boundary
	\item 
	Dealing with multi-event dependent sequences where the sequence may depend on detection of a cluster of events
	\end{enumerate}
  \item  Modeling sequences with state models %(Anil)
                \begin{enumerate}
                \item Convert sequence data to usage data
                \item Calculate usage probability
                \item Calculate transitional probability
                \item Visualization
                \item Data mining
                \end{enumerate}
