While it may seem like usage data tells everything about what a developer is doing, it usually leaves some gaps in the story (see \ref{Limitations}).  Augmenting usage data with additional data sources fills in the details necessary to understand what the user was doing.  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
	- usage data from tools of course
\item
	- usage data in user study smaller setting is augmented by user explicit feedback to establish ground truth (e.g. search result was good)
\item
	- smaller studies can ask questions about user activities that add rationale to the usage data that tells why user is doing what they are doing
\item
	- small studies can generate a metric you can use with larger data source that does not have augmented data.  E.g. structured navigation that Robillard did supports a larger study such as what we did at ABB.
    \end{itemize}
