\section{How to Collect Data or Get Pre-Existing Data}


  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Data sources

  \item Building Data Collection %(Dave and Kosta)
  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      What data is relevant to collect? (data granularity depends on needs of subsequent analysis and anticipated space and time overhead; collecting aggregate data vs. individual events; mention that data should be timestamped as a lot of subsequent analyses depend on that)
    \item
      How to modify existing tools to collect data? (events are a good communication paradigm; centralizing the logger in the code allows for consistent log messages and easy mainteance; trade-offs in storing logs as highly structured or somewhat unstructured data)
    \item
      Privacy and anonymity considerations when collecting data. (what not to collect, using hashes to protect user identities)
    \end{itemize}

  \item Instrumenting the IDE %(Will \& ?)

  \item Video studies %(?)

  \item Other methods

  \end{enumerate}
