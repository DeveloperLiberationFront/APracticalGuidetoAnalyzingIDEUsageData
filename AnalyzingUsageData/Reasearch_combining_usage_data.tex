Other data sources, such as task descriptions, change histories, and
news feeds can provide context for usage data and yield new opportunities for supporting developers. In this section, we briefly outline some related work in this area.
% that combines usage data with other data sources to a new set of applications. In this section, we outline the related work that combines usage data with other software engineering data sources.

\subsubsection{Tasks}

%Mylin
As mentioned above, Mylin is a popular extension to the Eclipse IDE that supports task
management, reducing the effort for a developer to switch between
tasks and maintaining relevant information for each
task~\cite{Kersten-Mylin}. In the context of a specific task, Mylin
collects usage data in order to compute a degree-of-interest (DOI)
value for each program element, which represents the interest the
developer has in the program element for the task at hand. Program elements that a developer interacted with frequently and recently have a higher DOI value. Using these calculated DOI values, Mylyn highlights the elements relevant for the current task and filters unnecessary information from common views in the IDE. 

\subsubsection{Change History}

%FastDash
The FastDash tool enables real-time awareness of other developers'
actions (e.g. focus or edits to a specific file) by utilizing usage
data in concert with the source files and
directories~\cite{FastDash}. FastDash's purpose is to reduce faults
caused by lack of communication and lack of awareness of activities
that other developers are performing on the same code base. The tool
highlights other developer's activity as it is occurring using a
sophisticated dashboard on the developer's screen or on a team's dashboard.
