@article{Kou2010Operational,
    abstract = {{Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100\% coverage, and so forth. However, research to validate these claims has yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We believe that at least part of the reason for these results stems from differing interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of TDD is in use.
                            Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the true nature of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings.
  This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD, the analyses made possible by Zorro, two empirical evaluations of the system, and an attempted case study. Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in order to do so. Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD, but also for software engineering   micro-process definition and recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream Analysis.}},

It addresses the problem that the log data recorded by standard web servers is not sufficient for the tracking of users on AJAX websites, e.g. to conduct a usability test. Using standard web technologies, our HTTP proxy can record very detailed usage information, such as mouse movements, clicks, key presses and scrolling, together with the exact HTML DOM tree objects involved. As we show in several case studies, the tracking also works across multiple websites, none of which needs to be under our control. This approach is much less invasive than previous efforts: The test person does not need to install software on her computer, and in certain operation modes, no configuration changes at all are required on her computer. Our research indicates that if the technology described in this paper is employed, arbitrary visitors of a website are more likely to take part in a usability test offered by that site -- this facilitates recruiting test participants over the Internet.}},

Since the behavior exhibited by individual developers when investigating a software system is influenced by intuition, experience, and skill, there is often significant variability in developer effectiveness. To understand the factors that contribute to effective program investigation behavior, we conducted a study of five developers performing a change task on a medium-size open source system. We isolated the factors related to effective program investigation behavior by performing a detailed qualitative analysis of the program investigation behavior of successful and unsuccessful developers. We report on these factors as a set of detailed observations, such as evidence of the phenomenon of inattention blindness by developers skimming source code. In general, our results support the intuitive notion that a methodical and structured approach to program investigation is the most effective.}},

Conclusions are that developers can be more effective using a methodological and structured approach relying on the structure of the program than approaches relying upon naming conventions and browsing the code.  Key points proven is that developers who understand the code and create a detailed plan for implementing the change are faster and more succesful.  Develpers who use structured navigation through dependencies and relationships and keyword searchs in the code are more successful than developers who scan the text looking for methods or other elements.  One factor may be a psychological effect known as inattention blindness where people not searching for something will miss the occurrence.  "e.g. gorilla on basketball court video".  Developers who did not reinvestigate methods frequently were more successful.  },

To explore these social solutions in one particular domain, we describe a series of interviews with 18 programmers in industry that explore how tool discovery takes place. These interviews provide a rich set of qualitative data that give us detailed insights into how programmers discover tools. One finding was that, while programmers believe that discovery from peers is effective, they actually discover tools from peers relatively infrequently. Another finding was that programmers can effectively discover tools from their peers both in a co-located and remote settings. We describe several implications of our findings, such as that discovery from peers can be enhanced by improving programmers' ability to communicate openly and concisely about tools.}},

However, little has been reported about the adoption of refactoring tools, and many assumptions about refactoring practice have little empirical support. In this paper, we examine refactoring tool usage and evaluate some of the assumptions made by other researchers. To measure tool usage, we randomly sampled code changes from four Eclipse and eight Mylyn developers and ascertained, for each refactoring, if it was performed manually or with tool support. We found that refactoring tools are seldom used: 11 percent by Eclipse developers and 9 percent by Mylyn developers. To understand refactoring practice at large, we drew from a variety of data sets spanning more than 39,000 developers, 240,000 tool-assisted refactorings, 2,500 developer hours, and 12,000 version control commits. Using these data, we cast doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others. Finally, we interviewed the Eclipse and Mylyn developers to help us understand why they did not use refactoring tools and to gather ideas for future research.}},

Hence, we present an approach for discovering and tracking evolving user profiles. We also describe how the discovered user profiles can be enriched with explicit information need that is inferred from search queries extracted from Web log data. Profiles are also enriched with other domain-specific information facets that give a panoramic view of the discovered mass usage modes.

    abstract = {{The understanding of development sessions, the phases during which a developer actively modifies a software system, is a valuable asset for program comprehension, since the sessions directly impact the current state and future evolution of a software system. Such information is usually lost by state-of-the-art versioning systems, because of the checkin/checkout model they rely on: a developer must explicitly commit his changes to the repository. Since this happens in arbitrary and sometimes long intervals, recovering the changes between two commits is difficult and inaccurate, and recovering the order of the changes is impossible. We have implemented an evolution monitoring prototype which records every semantic change performed on a system, and is able to completely reconstruct development sessions. In this paper we use this fine-grained information to understand and characterize the development sessions as they were carried out on two object-oriented systems.}},

Agile Methods promote some interesting practices, in particular the practice of refactoring, which are supposed to improve understandability and maintainability of source code. In this research we analyze if refactoring promotes ad-hoc reuse of object-oriented classes by improving internal quality metrics. We conduct a case study in a close-to industrial, agile environment in order to analyze the impact of refactoring on internal quality metrics of source code. Our findings sustain the hypothesis that refactoring enhances quality and reusability of – otherwise hard to reuse – classes in an agile development environment. Given such promising results, additional experimentation is required to validate and generalize the results of this work.}},

Applying gamification to software engineering is not as straightforward as it may appear since it has to be casted to the peculiarities of this domain. Existing literature in the area has already recognized the possible use of such technology in the context of software development, however how to design and use gamification in this context is still an open question.

A Degree of Interest records events such as a developer opening a file to edit and the developer actually making an edit in the file.  See the Eclipse Mylyn project. Being the first author of a code element was the most significant impact to the DOK value as rated by the developers themselves.  However, other factors combined with authorship were better match for expertise than authorship alone.  Previous approaches used only authorship (Expertise Recommender and Expertise Browser).  DOK was found to compare favorably with developer's personal opinion of who are experts in a particular code element.  It was useful for identifying recent changes due to defects that would be of interest to particular developers.  It was less useful for on-boarding because the ratings were mostly of lower level code elements rather than high level APIs which new people would need to become familiar with quickly.

@article{basili-GQM,
    abstract = {{Experience from a dozen years of analyzing software engineering processes and products is summarized as a set of software engineering and measurement principles that argue for software engineering process models that integrate sound planning and analysis into the construction process. In the TAME (Tailoring A Measurement Environment) project at the University of Maryland, such an improvement-oriented software engineering process model was developed that uses the goal/question/metric paradigm to integrate the constructive and analytic aspects of software development. The model provides a mechanism for formalizing the characterization and planning tasks, controlling and improving projects based on quantitative analysis, learning in a deeper and more systematic way about the software process and product, and feeding the appropriate experience back into the current and future projects. The TAME system is an instantiation of the TAME software engineering process model as an ISEE (integrated software engineering environment). The first in a series of TAME system prototypes has been developed. An assessment of experience with this first limited prototype is presented including a reassessment of its initial architecture}},
