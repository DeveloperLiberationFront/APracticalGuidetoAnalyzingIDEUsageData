\section{A Look Ahead}

If the last two decades could be labeled the era
of big data collection, 
the next two decades will surely be labeled as the 
era of smarter big data analysis.
Many questions still remain:
How do we balance data privacy and data richness?
What are the long term effects of developer monitoring?
How can we maximize the value of data collection
for as many researchers as possible, and reduce the 
strain on research participants?
Answering these questions will help our research
community advance in usage data collection and analysis.

Usage data, while now widely collected, still remains largely 
an untapped resource by practitioners and rearchers.
In this chapter, we have explained how to collect and 
anlayze usage data, which we hope will help you ``stand
on the shoulders of giants'' and increase the ease
with which you can collect and analyze your own usage data.
